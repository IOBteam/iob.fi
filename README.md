## Why this is a big deal:

iob.fi DAO is committed to making sure that our traders in the future will have **no longer need to** set up trading accounts all over the world \(as we have been doing until now\): New York, Chicago, Shanghai, London, Frankfurt, Sydney... nor is there a need to make foreign currency exchanges to fund those accounts.
