iob.fi is a DAO-governed **hedge fund manager**. Through its DeFi funds and the Prodefy technology platform, iob.fi enables both **retail investors** and **institutional traders** the opportunity to invest in _all asset classes_ including cryptos, stocks, commodities, and indices in one place with just a _Web3 wallet_. 

## Why this is a big deal:

Traders in the future will have **no need to** set up trading accounts all over the world as we have been doing: New York, Chicago, Shanghai, London, Frankfurt, Sydney... Nor is there a need to make foreign currency exchanges to fund those accounts. 

## On this docs section, you will find:

The frequently asked questions, iob.fi DAO and Defy DAO instructions, fund documentation and instructions, iob.fi liquidity pools on various exchanges, and developers' resources.
