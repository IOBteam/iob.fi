# FAQ

## General Questions

### What is iob.fi?

iob.fi is a decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\).

### What does iob.fi do?

iob.fi manages multi-asset-class hedge funds aiming to achieve superior returns with controlled max drawdowns.

Unable to find a Web3 solution for our "black box" trading system, we have decided to develop one for our own use and plan to open it for Wall Street firms.

### Why iob.fi?

iob.fi seeks consistent capital appreciation. With over 20 years managing various funds totaling billions of dollars, iob.fi founding members have develped a cryptocurrency trading system called ioBots. ioBots are rule-based algorithmic trading strategies, order, risk, and asset management tools.

In the past 12 months, ioBots have demonstrated above-average returns in real-time, real-money trading while being developed. ioBots-generated trading signals have been tracked in real-time. If the signals automatically invest in $10,000 for each trading signal, the total portfolio has made over 150% in the overall 12-month-period return. ioBots Signals add new trading pairs gradually. The 6 starting pairs achieving returns ranging from 183.9% to 597.35% for the first 12 months.

## Fund products for retail investors

### What's the most important thing in investment and trading success?

Consistency is the \#1 secret to be a winning trader, but most traders fail to achieve it. Long-term views always win in trading. Most failed traders inadvertently treating trading as an adventure, rather than a money-making business, therefore fail to achieve the consistency.

### What's the best trading strategy?

You start with a clear trading objective first. All methods of wealth growth start with a clear objective and an action plan. Simply stating "making lots of money" is neither. Same as running a successful business, trading strategies and setups are only meaningful with a clearly defined objective.

### Why am I not achieving trading consistency?

The key to consistency is to keep what you've earned, and the key to that is to clearly define your Expected Max Drawdown BEFORE entering any trade.

### **How to choose the best strategy?**

For any trading strategy to work well, you first must identify what the Market Type you are in currently.

### Why are the iob Market Types?

iob.fi identifies Very Bullish, Bullish, Choppy, Bearish and Very Bearish market types every day for each market we are trading through a proprietary algorithm.

### Why is market type awareness important?

Trading methods and strategies are not one size fits all. A certain strategy may work well in the bullish market, but lags in a bearish market. It is essential to have the right strategies for the right market type.

### Again, what's the best trading strategy?

This is no one single "best strategy." Very bullish, bullish, choppy, bearish and very bearish market types calls for different trading strategies.

### What are ioBots trading signals?

Trading Signals are buying and selling trading signals generated by ioBots developed by IOB LLC. Currently, ioBots are covering 20 markets, including BTC, ETH, ADA, XTZ, Gold, MSFT, and TSLA, among others. These are the same trading signals Quasar funds uses for all trading decisions. Started with 6 trading pairs in July 2019, 14 more markets were subsequently added. The best historical total return is BCH with 601.57% profit. The worst is XTZ with a loss of 11.46%. You can find detailed Signal performance history  [here](https://iob.fund/signal/history/BTCUSD).

### What is Quasar Fund?

Started on September 3, 2019, Quasar Fund was the real-time trading development tool for ioBots algorithmic development. It also serves as a real-time, real-money track record builder for IOB LLC fund managers.

### Why are the results of the signals better than that of Quasar Fund?

The Trading Signals and Quasar Fund have totally different objectives. Each "trading position" in the model portfolio is always [fully invested with $10,000](https://iob.fund/signals/portfolio), regardless the risk level of the signal. This results in a potentially big profits with larger per-position losses. The Model Portfolio represents an "Aggressive Growth" fund trading objective. A "Total Return" trading portfolio may have higher risk tolerance and a higher expected return.

### What is Defy Fund?

iob Defy Fund is the first tokenized, actively managed fund. Defy will invest in derivatives of non-correlated asset classes including cryptocurrencies, commodities and stock futures.

### What's the difference between Defy and liquidity pools?

Currently, all the diversified liquidity pools are passive mixers of tokens. Some of them are similar to sector-specific ETFs. Since cryptocurrencies are highly correlated, they may suffer large drawdowns \(sometimes over -80% return in a short period of holding them\) as the cryptocurrencies regularly exhibit in the past. Defy actively trading in derivatives representing different asset classes, mitigating excessive drawdown risk.

Most liquidity pool hold just a few high-flying tokens at the time of their creation. They may experience some extraordinary short-term uptrend movement, but their short-term focused design may not yield true meaningful long-term growth potential.

### What do I get by investing in Defy Fund?

The possibility of consistent capital appreciation for years to come. Defy Fund is not designed to chase the newest fad that may be associated with big risks.

To encourage our community-driven governance, Defy Fund investors and liquidity providers are rewarded with FI governance token staking rewards.

## Solutions for institutional investors

### What is Prodefy?

iob Prodefy is a unifying multi-financial protocols communication platform connecting FIX \(Financial Information eXchange\) protocol, Pillar and FAST protocols to Web3-enabled decentralized finance \(DeFi\) and cryptocurrency trading.

For the high-performance trading systems, Prodefy is akin to Bloomberg \(tm\) of DeFi.

### Who needs Prodefy?

The institutional hedge fund trades and Wall Street firms.

One of the obstacles that prevents the large hedge funds from the crypto investing and trading is that the crypto trading infrastructure is incompatible with their existing trading systems.

### Why can't Wall Street firms build their own DeFi solutions?

They certainly can. However, there are reasons, besides the current government regulatory and their internal compliance restrictions, why the institutional traders and investors are largely absent from the DeFi revolution.

The emergence of decentralized exchanges \(DEXes\) has fundamentally changes how trading takes place. Gone are the centralized order books, specialists and market makers who all have a natural advantage over small traders. Most Wall Street firms count their existence on those advantages.

Moreover, DeFi has some pros and cons for the professional traders, zero slippage is an attractive feature, but on-chain transactions renders some of the main benefits of HFT impossible.

### Who else can also benefit from Prodefy?

The cryptocurrency exchanges, both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Currently, they are only built for retail traders who are crypto enthusiasts who are willing to experiment the new financial revolution with limited and unreliable trading infrastructure.

Cryptocurrencies and DeFi will become a true force of change once the institutional establishments are on board. Through Prodefy, institutional investors with professional-grade trading systems are able to tap into the DeFi platforms. The exchanges can benefit with new trading volume that may be hundreds of times their current trading volumes.

What other major functionalities are being planned for Prodefy?

Unified asset and investment management. A single place to manage your asset and investment both in traditional and decentralized markets, as well as your funds' banking needs.

### What are the major applications Prodefy can be used in the near future?

Prodefy can be used by institutional traders for creating new derivatives trading pairs of any assets, synthetic indices and offering new index trading and actively managed trading products to their clients.

### What are the possible extensions for Prodefy?

When our own and the institutional clients' needs have exceeded the functionalities provided by the prevailing DEXs, we will work with them to deploying a robust trading venue.

## DeFi

### Why does iob.fi need DeFi?

#### Trading anything anywhere in the world

DeFi platforms are naturally suitable for iob.fi to create and to trade any asset classes globally with a universal market access. Synthetic derivatives break the common barriers of borders and fiat currencies. For instance, now anyone anywhere in the world can trade the gold futures with a Web3 wallet.

#### Permissionless

Trading without borders and gatekeepers. Markets are democratized for anyone to access and are governed by the transparency of smart contracts.

#### Secure

Your asset, your private key, your control.

#### New market opportunities

DeFi is the future of finance. iob.fi has deep understanding of both the traditional finance and the emerging decentralized finance. DeFi has only largely captured the imaginations and excitement of the retail investors and traders so far. There is a disconnection between between the old and new. DeFi innovations are led mostly by coders with little or no financial background, and that's the advantage they have, not being burdened by the old-fashion ways of thinking and predatory ways of doing business. However, the financial world is still being controlled by the traditional institutional players. We have witnessed that the two are belittling each other. We believe they will gradually adapt and penetrate each other's turfs. Being one of the first to build a bridge between the traditional and decentralized finance, iob.fi is in a similar position as the early days of the Bloomberg finance system.

## The FI Token

### What is FI?

FI is the iob.fi DAO governance token. It has no preset initial par value. Today FI is used for voting on proposals of all business aspects of iob.fi. FI will be used as a native token for Prodefy technology platform in Phase 2. FI holders will be given control of the iob.fi ecosystem in Phase 3 of the iob.fi product launch.

### Why does the iob.fi DAO need FI?

FI aligns incentives in the iob.fi DAO for value creation and economic growth. By linking demand for services to FI, the iob.fi DAO is able to benefit from the success of the products and services it provides. FI holders can also have a direct say in the evolution of the network by participating in governance.

### What is the FI token structure?

25% FI tokens are initially allocated to founding members, core contributors, advisors and partners, all subject to vesting periods.

5% were allocated for the Prodefy Ecosystem Fund. This fund will be deployed to attract and incentivize strategic partners that will help the Balancer ecosystem grow and thrive. FI holders will ultimately decide how this fund is used over the coming years.

The remaining 21.5% tokens are intended to be mostly distributed to iob.fi fund investors in the coming years.

### Do I get any additional benefits for holding FI over the long term?

By holding FI you can benefit from any potential increase in the value of the Aragon Network and its related services.

## The IOB Token

### What is IOB?

IOB was created in October 2017. The IOB LLC and iob.fi business are entirely funded by the funds from the sale of IOB tokens, along with some successful and failed investments in cryptocurrency projects.

### What is the exchange rate between IOB and FI tokens?

IOB holders have the right to convert their IOB into FI. Each conversion event is unique. Conversions are proposed by iob.fi core members initially, and are determined by the majority voting approval of the IOB holders on the iob.fi DAO. After certain numbers of IOB tokens are burnt, the entire IOB token control will be given to the IOB holders.

### What happens to the IOB tokens that were converted into FI?

The converted IOB tokens are considered as Redeemed and will be permanently burnt.

### How can IOB holders vote on iob.fi DAO?

IOB holders can wrap their IOB temporarily into wIOB on iob.fi. wIOB can then participate in voting on all proposals in the iob.fi DAO.
