## WHAT IS iob.fi DAO

##### DAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

##### Power to the people

Through the DAO, iob.fi clients, developers, fund investors and tokenholders are in control of the policies, new features and organizational governance.

##### Propose and vote

The community will propose and vote on policy updates, new-technology-implemented organizational changes, new fund structure, new product features, collaborative partnerships and whatever the community deems relevant.

The iob.fi DAO owns the most important smart contracts and assets that make up iob.fi.

It also owns a substantial purse of IOB and FI tokens which allows it to be truly autonomous as well as subsidize various operations and initiatives throughout iob.fi.

Voting takes place on the iob.fi's governance interface powered by Aragon

# Popular Vote

## A HYBRID VOTING SYSTEM

We are proposing a novel approach to help solve some of the problems.

##### True democracy

Not only for the rich. Anyone can vote for free

##### Earning FI through voting

Each successful vote on our DAOs is rewarded with FI token reward, paid out periodically.

##### Your free vote counts!

Your testnet vote result is delegated to a representative (an elector) on the Mainnet DAO to be cast on the proposal with a certain proportion of the total voting power.

## BUILD WITH US

Together, we make decisions as a group, reward individuals for their contributions, and share in the common benefit.

## SHARE THE SUCCESS

We are passionate about the value we are creating for the future of finance by bridging the institutional firms to the DeFi. There is a void between the established and the new.

The financial rewards for this innovation will be shared by all our community members and contributors.

###### IN A NUTSHELL
