# How to get USDC out of the Matic network?

Step 1 : Add **** [**Polygon Network**](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/)****

Step 2 : Connect to [**Matic (Polygon) on MetaMask**](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/faq/wallet-bridge-faq/#what-are-the-list-of-supported-exchanges-on-polygon)****

Step 3: Read your **USDC balance**

3.1 **** If you decide to keep USDC in the wallet on the Polygon network, do nothing.

3.2 To **transfer from the wallet**, first swap **a little MATIC token (5-10 cents)** using your USDC you just received via their gas-less swap feature.

step 4: If you want to **transfer USDC to an exchange**, you can only sent via the Polygon network to **crypto.com**, **OKEx** or **Binance** etc. **You will lose your USDC if you try to transfer them to any other exchange! Do NOT do it!**
