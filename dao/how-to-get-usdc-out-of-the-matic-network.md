3.1 **** If you decide to keep USDC in the wallet on the Polygon network, do nothing.

3.2 To **transfer from the wallet**, first swap **a little MATIC token (5-10 cents)** using your USDC you just received via their gas-less swap feature.

step 4: If you want to **transfer USDC to an exchange**, you can only sent via the Polygon network to **crypto.com**, **OKEx** or **Binance** etc. **You will lose your USDC if you try to transfer them to any other exchange! Do NOT do it!**
