##### A full-functional DeFi exchange

When our institutional clients' needs have exceeded the functionalities provided by the prevailing DEXs, we will work with them to deploying a robust trading venue.

#### A foundation for strategy building

A bridge between professional Wall Street firms and cryptos.

Until now, the decentralized finance solutions are only embraced by the grassroot individual blockchain enthusiasts.

Prodefy development is on track to deliver a suite of tools that traditional high-performance trading systems leverage to interact with Web3 enabled DeFi platforms.

DeFi has some pros and cons, zero slippage is an attractive feature, but on-chain transactions renders some of the main benefits of HFT impossible.

One of the obsticles the large hedge funds are absent from the crypto investing and trading is that the crypto trading infrastructure is incompatible with their existing trading systems.

Unable to find a Web3 solution for our "black box" trading system, we have decided to deverlop one for our own use and plan to open it for Wall St. firms.

DeFi will become a true force of change once the institutional establishments are on board. We stand to benefit as one of the first enablers.

## ROADMAP

###### Q1 2021

Bridge between professional Wall street firms and cryptos: Allows Wall Street to trade cryptos freely without significantly modifying their trading system or even creating a new one.

###### Q2 2021

Unified trading platform across traditional centralized and decentralized markets: Along with our high-performance interface to traditional market, e.g. NYSE, CME, etc., anyone can trade in both traditional financial markets and crypto DeFi markets. We are breaking down the barrier between these two types of markets.

###### Q4 2021

Unified asset and investment management: With our incoming cryptos/currency exchange capability, we will provide not only advanced trading technologies but also asset/investment management acrossing traditional financial world and new cryptocurrency world. We are breaking down the barrier between these two worlds.
